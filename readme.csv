Take an effort to learn "github" and "R package".

This sub-folder "YulongR_Code" is a subfoder under "C:\github" which is to hold all all repositories.  Each subfolder under "C:\github\" is a repository, so "YulongR_Code" is also a repository.
This sub-folder "YulongR_Code" consists of R scripts I think I can use to develope some R packages, which are scripts from some past works.

Steps to make this repository:

Step 0: invoke git bash.
Step 1: [git init YulogR_Code] under "C:\github\":  To initialize each of these repositories such as "YulongR_Code" under "C:\github\", do [git init YulogR_Code] under "C:\github\" for repository [YulongR_Code].
Step 2: [cd YulongR_Code]: Then switch inside to "YulongR_Code" to do all other manipulations.
Step 3: Create a same named reppository in github and copy the https URL
Step 4: [git remote add origin https://github.com/YulongXieGitHub/YulongR_Code]:	connect to github from git bash.
Step 5: [git remote -v]: view the github connections
Step 6: [git add .]: staging everything in this "YulongR_Code" folder
Step 7: [git diff --cached]: this will see all contents we just staged.
Step 8: [git commit -m 'initialization']:	commit to preserve the snapshot.
Step 9: [git diff --cached]: nothing new in the staging area since every thing have been push to the local repository already.
Step 10: [git pull origin master]: successfully pull data out from github
Step 10: [git push origin master]: it propmts used name: YulongXieGitHub and password: But failed to push data to github.  Fatal: Authentication failed!!!!!!!!!!
